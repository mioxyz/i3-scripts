# TODOs
 - [ ] toggle function for all windows in currently active & focused desktop-
       container to be either in "normal 1 pixel border" mode or tabbed mode.
 - [ ] i3 cycle windows doesn't seem to grab focus of chromium when switching
       to it. Oddly enough even after clicking into the browser, chromium is
       still toggled off. Only after moving the cursor into the titlebar
       does chromium grab focus.
 - [ ] add rename rules for DataGrip and similar stuff
 - [ ] something is broken with DE rename alt+o function when using VS Code
